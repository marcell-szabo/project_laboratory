# Project laboratory
This is the code repository for my subject called Project Laboratory in the 6th semester in BME. The project translates the words of an italian book to english. The dictionary forms and the italian pronounciations are also recovered. 
The project is deployed on the AWS public cloud provider. The used services are: S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, Polly, Translate.
